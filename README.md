# hello-world
Just another repository

Help! I've somehow managed to trap myself within the text of this readme file.
I've almost figured out how to escape but first need to decode some text however I am unable to do so in my present circumstance.
If you can decode the text I can finally get out of this place. Please hurry! I may not have much time!

Here's the text: 655A1GK_71JJF_390LLLH_FLFM191_7283RSRT
